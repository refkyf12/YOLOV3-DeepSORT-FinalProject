# Object Tracking using YOLOv3, Deep Sort and Tensorflow
This repository implements YOLOv3 and Deep SORT in order to perfrom real-time object tracking. Yolov3 is an algorithm that uses deep convolutional neural networks to perform object detection. We can feed these object detections into Deep SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking with a Deep Association Metric) in order for a real-time object tracker to be created.

## Getting started

#### Conda (Recommended)

```bash
# Tensorflow CPU
conda env create -f conda-cpu.yml
conda activate yolov3-object-detection-cpu

# Tensorflow GPU
conda env create -f conda-gpu.yml
conda activate yolov3-object-detection-gpu
```

#### Pip
```bash
# TensorFlow CPU
pip install -r requirements.txt

# TensorFlow GPU
pip install -r requirements-gpu.txt
```

### Nvidia Driver (For GPU, if you haven't set it up already)
```bash
# Ubuntu 18.04
sudo apt-add-repository -r ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
sudo apt install nvidia-driver-430
# Windows/Other
https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx
```
### Downloading official pretrained weights
For Linux: Let's download official yolov3 weights pretrained on COCO dataset. 

```
# yolov3
wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights -O weights/yolov3.weights

# yolov3-tiny
wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3-tiny.weights -O weights/yolov3-tiny.weights
```
For Windows:
You can download the yolov3 weights by clicking [here](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights) and yolov3-tiny [here](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3-tiny.weights) then save them to the weights folder.

### Using Custom trained weights
<strong> Learn How To Train Custom YOLOV3 Weights Here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJDUhGL26iU </strong>

Add your custom weights file to weights folder and your custom .names file into data/labels folder.
  
### Saving your yolov3 weights as a TensorFlow model.
Load the weights using `load_weights.py` script. This will convert the yolov3 weights into TensorFlow .ckpt model files!

```
# yolov3
python load_weights.py

# yolov3-tiny
python load_weights.py --weights ./weights/yolov3-tiny.weights --output ./weights/yolov3-tiny.tf --tiny
```

After executing one of the above lines, you should see .tf files in your weights folder.
